# Hack The Box - Pentesting Labs

Hack The Box is an online platform allowing you to test your penetration
testing skills and exchange ideas and methodologies with other members of
similar interests. It contains several challenges that are constantly updated.
Some of them simulating real world scenarios and some of them leaning more
towards a CTF style of challenge.

As an individual, you can complete a simple challenge to prove your skills and
then create an account, allowing you to connect to our private network (HTB Labs)
where several machines await for you to hack them.
By hacking machines you get points that help you advance in the Hall of Fame.

Go ahead and try to hack the invite code in order to become a member!
